🌱 Project Highlight: Potato Disease Prediction Using CNN

I’m thrilled to share my latest project—a web application that predicts potato leaf diseases with remarkable precision using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model!

🥔 Problem Statement: Potato farming is vital for food security, but diseases like late blight and early blight can significantly reduce yield. Early detection can save crops and support farmers.

💡 Solution: I developed a system that enables users to upload images of potato leaves, and the application instantly predicts whether the leaf is diseased or healthy.

🔍 Results:

Achieved 99% training accuracy and 100% validation accuracy.
Provided a robust solution for farmers to diagnose diseases early and take preventive action.
🔧 Technology Stack:

Frontend: ReactJS
Backend: FastAPI
Machine Learning Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib
📊 Methodology:

Data Collection: Used a dataset containing images of healthy and diseased potato leaves.
Model Development:
Designed a CNN model with multiple convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction.
Optimized the model using Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
Web Application:
Developed a ReactJS-based frontend for users to upload leaf images.
Integrated the FastAPI backend to process the images and provide predictions in real time.
💻 Features:

User-Friendly Interface: A simple interface for farmers and agricultural experts.
Instant Predictions: Upload a leaf image and get immediate results.
Scalability: Built for future integration with other crop disease models.
